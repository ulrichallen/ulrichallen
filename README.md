# 🛡️ Preventive Cybersecurity with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository presents a practical and educational project exploring how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like DistilBERT can be leveraged for **preventive cybersecurity** — identifying and mitigating threats such as phishing, prompt injection, and data/model poisoning.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎓 Developed as part of the **Frontier Tech Leaders Programme**
- 🧠 Focused on the intersection of **AI** and **Cybersecurity**
- 🔍 Demonstrates the use of **LLMs for detecting suspicious emails**
- ⚠️ Discusses selected risks from the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Show how LLMs can support proactive threat detection
- Demonstrate a real-world use case: phishing email classification
- Promote responsible and secure use of LLMs in sensitive environments

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Risks with LLMs (based on OWASP Top 10)

This project explores specific vulnerabilities:
- Prompt Injection
- Data and Model Poisoning
- Excessive Agency

It also provides **mitigation strategies** for each risk.

## ✅ Best Practices Suggested

- Combine LLMs with rule-based and SIEM tools
- Use secure training pipelines and filtered input/output
- Monitor for model drift and update regularly
- Restrict API access and limit excessive autonomy

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- DistilBERT (NLP model)
